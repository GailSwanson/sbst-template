# About nothing

Welcome to the alpha site for the US Government web pattern library project.

This pattern library is intended to provide reference for designers, developers, as well as anyone else interested in the design and frontend principles that make up the building blocks of federal government websites.

This site is currently under development and your feedback is important to us. We encourage you to contribute your input at https://github.com/18F/govt-wide-patternlibrary/issues.
